  "body": "## Data Analysis and Interpretation\r\nis a [coursera specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis) I'm following. It teaches the basics of data analysis in Python (or SAS), which I found intriguing enough to give it a try. In addition to Python, I'm using R to do (more or less) the same analysis steps and compare the two languages.  \r\nThe results are actually published and discussed on my [tumblr](http://lilithelina.tumblr.com/), but are better readable with the GitHub infrastructure behind them. This is why you can find the IPython/Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown files and their respective HTML and Markdown result files here. In case you are not familiar with the possibilities, you can nicely display .ipynb files with the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) or HTML files with the [HTML preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).\r\n\r\nThe specialisation consists of four courses: [Data Management and Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization), [Data Analysis Tools](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-tools), [Regression Modeling in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice), [Machine Learning for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis), and a capstone ([Data Analysis and Interpretation Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-capstone)).  \r\nBelow, you can find a list of the courses and their weekly assignments I have already completed and uploaded here:\r\n\r\n**Data Management and Visualisation** ([DataManViz](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/tree/master/DataManViz))\r\n\r\n* [Selecting a research question](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week%20One.md)\r\n* Writing your first program ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week%20Two.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week_Two.md))\r\n* Managing data ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week%20Three.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week_Three.md))\r\n* Visualising data ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week%20Four.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataManViz/Week_Four.md))\r\n\r\n**Data Analysis Tools** ([DataAnaT](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/tree/master/DataAnaT))\r\n\r\n* Hypothesis testing and ANOVA ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week%20One%20-%20ANOVA.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week_One_ANOVA.md))\r\n* Chi square test of independence ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week%20Two%20-%20Chi-Square.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week_Two_Chi.md))\r\n* Pearson correlation ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week%20Three%20-%20Pearson%20Correlation.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week_Three_Pearson.md))\r\n* Exploring statistical interactions ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week%20Four%20-%20Causation.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/DataAnaT/Week_Four_Moderator.md))\r\n\r\n**Regression Modeling in Practice** ([RegModPrac](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/tree/master/RegModPrac))\r\n\r\n* [Introduction to regression](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/RegModPrac/Week%20One.md)\r\n* Basics of linear regression ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/RegModPrac/Week%20Two%20-%20Basic%20Linear%20Regression.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/RegModPrac/Week_Two_BasicRegression.md))\r\n* Multiple regression ([Python](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/RegModPrac/Week%20Three%20-%20Polynomial%20Regression.md) | [R](https://github.com/LilithElina/Data-Analysis-and-Interpretation/blob/master/RegModPrac/Week_Three_PolynomialRegression.md))\r\n",
