## Data Analysis and Interpretation
is a [coursera sepcialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis) I'm following. It teaches the basics of data analysis in Python (or SAS), which I found intriguing enough to give it a try.
The results are actually published and discussed on my [tumblr](http://lilithelina.tumblr.com/), but are better readable with the GitHub infrastructure behind them. This is why you can find the IPython notebooks, RMarkdown files and their respective HTML and Markdown result files here. In case you are not familiar with the possibilities, you can nicely display .ipynb files with the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) or HTML files with the [HTML preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).
