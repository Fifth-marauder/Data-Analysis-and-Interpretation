## Describing Data

It's time to start the next course in the [Data Analysis and Interpretation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis) specialisation of Wesleyan University: [Regression Modeling in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-modeling-practice/home/welcome)! (Previous work can be found [here](http://lilithelina.tumblr.com/DataManViz) and [here](http://lilithelina.tumblr.com/DataAnaT).) In the first week, we learned what the difference between observational and experimental data is, what some common problems about data and experimental design are, and that correlation does not equal causation. Topic of our first assignment is describing our data, though, so here goes...


**Sample**

The sample used on this blog belongs to the [GapMinder](http://www.gapminder.org/) data set. GapMinder is a non-profit venture born at the [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/startpage) that aims to fight ignorance by providing data that everybody can understand. These data include over 200 indicators collected from all 192 UN member states and 24 other areas (N=215). Data sources include the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, United Nations Statistics Division, the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation, and others.

The data so far analysed on this blog comprises new breast cancer cases per 100,000 females provided by the [International Agency for Research on Cancer](http://www.iarc.fr/) (IARC) (used as explanatory variable), the percentage of employed females (aged 15+) provided by the [International Labour Organisation](http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm) (ILO), and internet users per 100 people provided by the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) as response variables, and the income per person as the gross national income per capita in 2000 US$ provided by the World Bank's [Work Development Indicators](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) (as moderator).


**Procedure**

All variables used here were generated by data reporting and are observational.  
Income per person was calculated by dividing the gross national income by midyear population, based on values from 2010.  
New breast cancer cases in 2002 were compiled by GapMinder from IARC time series data.  
The female employment rates from 2007 were downloaded from the ILO.  
Internet use rates in 2010 were downloaded from the World Bank.


**Measures**

The four measures listed above were, whenever possible, used as the quantitative data they were provided as. Data management was only done to remove countries/areas in which at least one variable was not measured. If categorical data was expected, variables were grouped into four categories based on quartile splits as needed.
